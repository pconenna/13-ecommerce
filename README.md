# E-Commerce App

## Description
This project is the backend of an e-commerce app. The main focus of the app is the products. The products are classified by categories and tags. Products, tags, and categories all have CRUD functionality via the API. A user must use a third party app such as Insomnia or Postman to send requests to the api endpoints.

## Installation 
The code must be cloned from the repository.

## Usage
Navigate to the root directory of the project in the terminal and run nodemon server.js. Open Insomnia and build a request to the desired enpoint. The local version of the app runs on port 3001. The possible endpoints are http://localhost:3001/api/categories/ http://localhost:3001/api/products/ http://localhost:3001/api/tags/ . Putting a number at the end of the URL can be used in GET methods to get a single item by its ID number instead of getting all existing items at the endpoint. 

## Testing
Testing and usage are the same.

## Credits
I got help from both TA's, MJ Shelton and Brian Baker. They helped me fix my model relationships. Everything done outside of the one time I met with them was done alone.
